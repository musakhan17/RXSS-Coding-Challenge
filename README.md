# RXSS-Coding-Challenge
An API to find the nearest Pharmacy from your location.

This project uses the Haversine formula. The Haversine formula is used generally for computing great-circle distances between two pairs of coordinates on a sphere.
It is used in the SQL statement that finds the nearest pharmacy by searching and comparing the user's longitude and latitude with the pharmacy's.
The data.php searches through the database 'pharmacies.csv' and outputs the nearest pharmacy to your location.
Output is the Name, Address and the Distance (in miles) between the user and the pharmacy.
